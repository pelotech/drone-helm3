|------------------------|----------|----------|------------------------|---------|

### Where to put settings

Any setting can go in either the `settings` or `environment` section. If a setting exists in _both_ sections, the version in `environment` will override the version in `settings`.

We recommend putting all drone-helm3 configuration in the `settings` block and limiting the `environment` block to variables that are used when building your charts.

### Formatting non-string values

* Booleans can be yaml's `true` and `false` literals or the strings `"true"` and `"false"`.
* Durations are strings formatted with the syntax accepted by [golang's ParseDuration function](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) (e.g. 5m30s)
  * For backward-compatibility with drone-helm, a duration can also be an integer, in which case it will be interpreted to mean seconds.
* List\<string\>s can be a yaml sequence or a comma-separated string.

All of the following are equivalent:

```yaml
values: "foo=1,bar=2"
values: ["foo=1", "bar=2"]
values:
  - foo=1
  - bar=2
```

Note that **list members must not contain commas**. Both of the following are equivalent:

```yaml
values_files: [ "./over_9,000.yml" ]
values_files: [ "./over_9", "000.yml" ]
```

### Interpolating secrets into the `values`, `string_values` and `add_repos` settings

If you want to send secrets to your charts, you can use syntax similar to shell variable interpolation--either `$VARNAME` or `$${VARNAME}`. The double dollar-sign is necessary when using curly brackets; using curly brackets with a single dollar-sign will trigger Drone's string substitution (which can't use arbitrary environment variables). If an environment variable is not set, it will be treated as if it were set to the empty string.

```yaml
environment:
  DB_PASSWORD:
    from_secret: db_password
  SESSION_KEY:
    from_secret: session_key
settings:
  values:
    - db_password=$DB_PASSWORD    # db_password will be set to the contents of the db_password secret
    - db_pass=$DB_PASS            # db_pass will be set to "" since $DB_PASS is not set
    - session_key=$${SESSION_KEY} # session_key will be set to the contents of the session_key secret
    - sess_key=${SESSION_KEY}     # sess_key will be set to "" by Drone's variable substitution
```

Variables intended for interpolation must be set in the `environment` section, not `settings`.

### Backward-compatibility aliases

Some settings have alternate names, for backward-compatibility with drone-helm. We recommend using the canonical name unless you require the backward-compatible form.

| Canonical name       | Alias |
|----------------------|-------|
| mode                 | helm_command |
| add_repos            | helm_repos |
| kube_api_server      | api_server |
| kube_service_account | service_account |
| kube_token           | kubernetes_token |
| kube_certificate     | kubernetes_certificate |
| wait_for_upgrade     | wait |
| force_upgrade        | force |
